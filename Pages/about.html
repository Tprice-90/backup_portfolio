					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p>Some of my hobbies include gaming and music</p>

					<h3>Gaming</h3>
					<p>For most of my life I have been a huge fan of gaming on all platforms from the original Nintendo to Xbox 
					   One. It has been a leading factor in my schooling path because earlier on in my life I wanted to design 
					   video games that millions of people would enjoy. This later evolved into a more general web developement 
					   path when I decided that game developement itself was not the exact career I wanted to get into.</p>
					
					<p>In this section I will go over some of my favourite games from throughout the years.</p>

					<h4>Super Mario Bros. 3</h4>

					</figure>
					
					<p>My very first memory in gaming was being at my nana's house playing Super Mario Bros. 3. I consider this game 
					   as one of the best video games of all time. While, I played the other 2 games in this series, this was the first 
					   time I remember putting all my effort into not only completing the game, but finding all the different secrets 
					   and areas there were to explore. To this day I sometimes go back to playing it just for the nostalgia that it 
					   brings to me.</p>

					<h4>World of Warcraft</h4>

						<figcaption>World of warcraft 2021/03/28 Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Of_Warcraft</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>This was my first entry into Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing gaming. WoW is a true classic when it 
						comes to MMORPGs because it allows you to truly play a role and immerse yourself in a massive world to explore. 
						While the current oppinion of the game is that it has been watered down content-wise, I have many good memories 
						of logging on with my school friends and going on quests, leveling up and just generally having a really good time.</p>				

					<h4>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h4>

					</figure>
					
					<p>Skyrim was my first entry in the Elder Scrolls series of games, and to this day I still consider it a masterpiece in 
					   terms of Role Playing Games. This game, like World Of Warcraft allowed you to immerse yourself into a world that felt 
					   real. Playing as a weapon-weilding Warrior, sneaky Thief, spell slinging Mage, or anything in between, Skyrim was a massive 
					   world that I spent hours exploring.</p>

					<h4>Call of Duty</h4>
					<figure>

					</figure>
					
					<p>Call of Duty is one of my favourite series in the First Person Shooter genre of gaming. There are many titles in this series 
					   that I have played but my favourite has to be a tie between Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2. From the very well designed Campaign 
					   mode(Story) to the dark and high stress Zombies mode, Call Of Duty is another title that I spent countless hours with friends 
					   playing.</p>

					<h3>Music</h3>
					
					<p>Music has always been an important part of my life. I use music to de-stress, get excited, and help me better understand how I am 
					   feeling. I also consider myself a novice Musician, as I do play guitar and bass. I have also had some experience drumming but never 
					   practiced enough to consider myself proficient.</p>
					
					<img src="../Img/JayTurser2.jpg" alt="Performing" />
					
					<p>My current guitars include; a Jay Turser Purple Serpent which is a Gibson Les Paul style guitar which holds a lot of meaning to me. 
					   I have used it to perform in a handful of live shows.</p>
					
					<img src="../Img/JayTurser.jpg" alt="Jay Turser Guitar" />
					
					<p>My other guitar is an acoustic Epiphone which is the main guitar I use around the house when I am inspired to play.</p>

					<p>Other instuments that I have experience with are Trumpet and Flute but I only played these in school.</p>
