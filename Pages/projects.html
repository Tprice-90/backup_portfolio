				   and a case study about copyright infringements.</p>

				<h2>An Elevator Pitch Video</h2>
				<video controls>
					<source src="../Img/Elevator_Pitch.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>

				<p>This was a 30 second video I made to demonstrate how to perform an 
				   elevator pitch, which emulates meeting a potential employer on an 
				   elevator and describing why they should hire you within 30 seconds 
				   or less which is the average time of an elevator ride.</p>

				<p>This project helped me practice my communication skills as well as 
				   helped me develope video production and editing skills.</p>

				<h2>HTML Final Assignment Website</h2>
				<img src="../Img/Website_final.png" alt="HTML Final" />

				<p>This was a final project for my HTML/CSS course in my first semester 
				   which brought together all the skills I acquired durring the course. 
				   It involved creating a web form and sending the information from that 
				   form to an external page to be processed.</p>

				<h2>Court Case Summary</h2>

				<p><a href="../Img/bell_v_validas.pdf">This</a> was a project which involved 
				   reading through the proceedings of a trademark registration court case involving the opponent Bell Mobility 
				   Inc and the applicant Validas LLC. The goal was to summerize in plain 
				   terms the court level, arguments and evidence from each party and to 
				   explain what the resulting ruling by the judges was. This project helped 
				   strengthen my understanding of the legal system in regards to copyright 
				   infringements in an online setting.</p>
