				<p>To start, my name is Terry Price. I am a student of Internet 
			       Applications and Web Design at St. Clair College. I chose 
			       this program because I wanted to devlope the skills needed to
			       persue a career in web developement and perhaps continue on to 
			       other areas in computer programming. I am currently employed at 
			       the Dominion Golf Course and Country Club as a cook, which has 
			       given me much experience in working not only as a team, but 
			       independantly as well.</p>
			   
				<p>I would like to thank you for visiting my portfolio page. On this 
			       site I would like to give more of an in depth look into my hobbies, 
			       my past work experience, skills and other information you may find 
			       interesting.</p>
